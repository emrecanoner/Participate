# Participate

Most people don't like to be alone. There will even be those who find it boring. How many of us go to the movies, the theater or for coffee alone? Besides, who wouldn't want to spend time with people we have in common? At this point, our PARTICIPATE application comes to the aid of all of us. For example, a new movie has been released and you don't have friends to watch with. You also want to make new friends. After registering to application and choosing your city, you can create an event with details such as when the event will start and end. So other users in the city can see and join your activity.

<strong>"No matter how legendary are the things, if you don't have friends to share them with"</strong>
